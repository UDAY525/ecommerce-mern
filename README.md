## Features
1. **Multiple User Access**: Our app supports multiple user accounts, allowing both buyers and sellers to create and manage their profiles.
2. **Full-Scale Authentication**: We have implemented a robust authentication system that ensures secure access to user accounts. It includes features like registration, login, logout, and a forgot password option.
3. **Payment Gateway**: Seamless integration with a reliable payment gateway enables users to make secure online payments for their purchases.
4. **Search Functionality**: Users can easily search for products using keywords or specific terms to find the desired items quickly.
5. **Filtering Options**: The app provides filtering options based on price range and product categories, allowing users to refine their search results and find relevant products more efficiently.
